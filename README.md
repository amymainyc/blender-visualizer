# Blender Visualizer (WIP)
A site that displays all of my 3D modeling projects from [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) made with [three.js](https://threejs.org).

### Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), 
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only for first time)
npm i

# Serve at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
